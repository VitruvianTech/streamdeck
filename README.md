# Stream Deck Scripts
A collection of PowerShell scripts, specifically for use as Elgato Stream Deck Open (System) files.

## Mute

This script toggles muting the default audio input device (microphone), resets the input volume to 100% (when unmuted), and presents a tooltip balloon indicating mute status. Scripted for Windows 10, and primarily used with the Elgato Stream Deck (set as System script.)
